# TODO
- [ ] Use R-tree?
- [ ] Read Blender OBJ files
- [ ] Texture on objects
- [ ] Collision between rays and general objects.
- [ ] Parsing inputs: https://www.cplusplus.com/articles/DEN36Up4/

# How it works

* Start by placing objects in a 3d world.
* Consider looking at the world through a camera (~ 1 point at the center
  looking through a screen that has width x height pixels.)
* For each pixel, looking from the center towards that pixel and see if it
  encounters an object.
* If it encounters an object calculate the color, else give the "default
  background color" to that pixel.

# Requirements
* C++ 11
