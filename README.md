# Done
- [x] Triplet Class
- [x] Colour Class
- [x] Vector3 Class
- [x] Image class. To have an array representing each pixel
- [x] Intersection between a ray and a triangle
- [x] Collision between ray and sphere.
- [x] Make the camera class
- [x] Make a geometry class (which has a color, and I guess later, texture,
  roughness, ...) and Triangle a daughter of it.

# TODO
- [ ] Properly treat several objects and go through them for rendering
- [ ] Collision between rays and general objects.
- [ ] Use R-tree?
- [ ] Read Blender OBJ files
- [ ] Parsing inputs: https://www.cplusplus.com/articles/DEN36Up4/

# How it works

* Start by placing objects in a 3d world.
* Consider looking at the world through a camera (~ 1 point at the center
  looking through a screen that has width x height pixels.)
* For each pixel, looking from the center towards that pixel and see if it
  encounters an object.
* If it encounters an object calculate the color, else give the "default
  background color" to that pixel.
