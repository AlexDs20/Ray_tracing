# Done
- [x] Triplet Class
- [x] Colour Class
- [x] Vector3 Class
- [x] Image class. To have an array representing each pixel
- [x] Intersection between a ray and a triangle
- [x] Collision between ray and sphere.
- [x] Make the camera class
- [x] Make a geometry class (which has a color, and I guess later, texture,
  roughness, ...) and Triangle a daughter of it.

# TODO
- [ ] Properly treat several objects and go through them for rendering
- [ ] input to main -> filename
- [ ] Collision between rays and general objects.
- [ ] Use R-tree?
- [ ] Read Blender OBJ files
